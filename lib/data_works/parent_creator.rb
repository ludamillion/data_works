    # Consider the case where a model has a has_one relationship with its

    # before_validation or after_initialize.
    #
    # This can confuse DataWorks because DataWorks creates models by starting
    # at the child and creating all of the necessary ancestors.  It's a
    # "child creates parent" strategy.  When a model class autocreates a
    # child, it happens outside of DataWorks so DataWorks does not know about
    # it and it goes against the flow since it has a "parent creates child"
    # strategy.
    #
    # The upshot is that a bunch of unmanaged zombie objects will be lying
    # around that could disrupt tests.  So we specifically have to delete
    # any model objects that a parent may have created outside of DataWorks
    # before they cause trouble.
